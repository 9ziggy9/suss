* suss
  suss is a very sus dialect of Lisp named in honor of Gerald Jay Sussman, co-author of the scheme dialect.
** Dependencies
Not happy about these.
*** libedit
This is incredibly useful, I must admit. It appears (?) to have come pre-installed on my distribution (Arch Linux). This allows us to press up to move through command history in our interpreter. Evidently, this does not rely on ncurses or termcap which should actually reduce size. I think I will eventually statically link with this if I have to.
#+BEGIN_SRC console
sudo pacman -S libedit
#+END_SRC
Link with -ledit
